## I Personally Make

- **Anti-Cheat Bypasses**: 
  - Anti-cheat bypasses for games like *Da Hood* and *Hood Customs*.

- **HVH Functions**: 
  - **No-Recoil**: Eliminates weapon recoil for more accurate shots.
  - **No-Spread**: Removes gun spread to ensure perfect aim.
  - **Bullet TP**: Teleports bullets to the target for instant hits.
  - **Auto-Stomp**: Automatically stomps players when they are down.
  - **Auto-Stomp on Kill**: Automatically stomps a player when they are killed.
  - **Auto-Bring Player**: Automatically brings a player to your position (useful for HVH scenarios).
  - **ForceHit**: Automatically hits a specific body part (e.g., head, torso) regardless of where you aim. (mostly will always 2 tap if its on head for hood customs)
  - **Db Sniper**: Increases your db (double barrel) gun shot range.
